# Oblig2

Here is my oblig2 assignment. I had problems with the git classroom link so i desided to make my own repository. 

In my assigment i have used the base code from oblig1 but i have added springboot, and made it possible to use bootstrap. I did not use jQuery because i simpy think it is easier to do it with Java.
